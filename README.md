Overview

This project implements machine learning models for data analysis, including classification, regression (prediction), and clustering. The dataset used is the Iris dataset, but it can be replaced with any dataset of choice.

Features

Classification: Uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict the class of flowers.

Regression: Uses Linear Regression to predict sepal length based on other features.

Clustering: Implements K-Means clustering to group similar data points.

Data Preprocessing: Standardizes the dataset for better model performance.

Data Visualization: Uses Seaborn for graphical representation of clusters.
